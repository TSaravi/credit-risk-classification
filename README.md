# credit-risk-classification

## Overview of the Analysis

The purpose of this analysis is to train and evaluate a model based on loan risk. Using the historical dataset for lending activies from peer-to-peer lending service company to build a model that can identify the creditworthiness of borrowers. Using the dataset, we can predict if a potential loan will be a healthly loan or a high-risk loan.

The steps taken to create this manchine learning models are as follow;
Step 1. split the data into training and testing sets
Step 2. create a logistical regression model with the original data
Step 3. predict a logistic regression model with the oversampled training data

## Results


* Machine Learning Model 1:
* 
  * Balanced accuracy score is 94.4%
  * Healthly loan precision score of 1.00 and recall score of 1.00
  * High-risk loan precision score of 0.94 and recall score of 0.94

* Machine Learning Model 2:
  * Description of Model 2 Accuracy, Precision, and Recall scores.
  * Balanced accuracy score is 99.6%
  * Healthly loan precision score of 1.00 and recall score of 1.00
  * High-risk loan precision score of 0.94 and recall score of 1.00

## Summary
In summary, both models were able to predict the 100% accuracy for the healthy loans. For high-risk loans, model 2 was able to correctly predict with a higher accuracy rate than model 1. Therefore, model 2 is recommended method for prediction
